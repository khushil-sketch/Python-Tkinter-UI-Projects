# Tkinter-Based-Projects
Repo containing simple projects made using Python's Tkinter Library. There are 3 apps that I created using tkinter:
1. Calculator 
2. Address book
3. Air Quality Indicator

## Calculator
Created only using tkinter, can only do addition

## Address book
Created using tkinter and SQLite 3 since it was necessary to have a database management system to store and handle the information given to the address book.

## Air Quality Indicator
Created using tkiner and the requests library in conjunction with the Air Now API. To use the API, you shall need to insert your personal API key in the designated area, which I have marked in the code. You can get your API key from here: https://docs.airnowapi.org/
