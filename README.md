# Tkinter-Based-Projects
Repo containing projects made using Python's Tkinter UI Library. There are 3 apps that I created using tkinter:
1. Calculator 
2. Address book
3. Air Quality Indicator

## Calculator
Created only using tkinter, can only do addition.

## Address book
Stores names and contact information.
Interface desgined using tkinter and back-end implemented with SQLite.

## Air Quality Indicator
Created using tkinter and the requests library in conjunction with the AirNow API. To use the API, you shall need to insert your personal API key in the designated area, which I have marked in the code. You can get your API key from here: https://docs.airnowapi.org/
