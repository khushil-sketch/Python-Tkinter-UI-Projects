# Python-Projects
Repo containing projects made using Python's Tkinter UI Library. There are 3 apps that I created using tkinter:
1. Calculator 
2. Address book
3. Air Quality Indicator

## Calculator

I created a calculator application as a heartfelt tribute to the early computers that were originally designed as calculators. Inspired by their pioneering spirit, this app embodies the essence of those historical machines while incorporating modern functionality. It serves as a nostalgic reminder of the technological progress we have achieved and celebrates the roots of computing.

## Address book
Coded an addressbook - it stores people's names and other contact information.
Desgined it using tkinter and SQLite.

## Air Quality Indicator

I developed an air quality indicator application with the aim to address the pressing issue of global warming and smog affecting people in developed countries. By providing real-time air quality information, the app empowers users to make informed decisions to safeguard their health and encourages collective action towards mitigating environmental challenges.
Created using Tkinter and the Requests library in conjunction with the AirNow API. To use the API, you shall need to insert your personal API key in the designated area, which I have marked in the code. You can get your API key from here: https://docs.airnowapi.org/
